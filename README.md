# Desjardins AutoFocus
 
I was tired of literally typing my whole code then realizing that the input wasn't focused so I created this extension to auto focus on it

# How to install?
1. Download this repository as a zip file. (Code tab > Download ZIP)
2. Unpack the zip file to a folder of your choosing (outside Download folder to avoid deleting it by accident)
3. Head to __chrome://extensions__
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click __Load unpacked__
6. Select the folder you extracted the zip to.
7. It should be installed.

# How to use?
The extension will only access the 2FA page to autofocus the input.

If you are having any problem with the extension. Make sure to let me know.
